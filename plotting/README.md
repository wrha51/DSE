# Plotting

This directory contains several scripts and tools related to the visualization
of the output of ZigZag. This is meant to make ZigZag more user-friendly.

To use the plotting functions of ZigZag :arrow_down_small:
 - Move inside this directory,
 - Use the [plot_simple](plot_simple.py) script to get some visualization of the results. The syntax is `python3 plot_simple.py $path_to_your_results`.

Alternatively, you may also write your own plotting scripts using the functions defined by the [reader class](reader.py). Examplesof using those functions are shown in an [example file](example.py).
